    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are dense vectors of real numbers, one per word in your\n",
    "vocabulary. In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are\n",
    "words! But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could\n",
    "store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what\n",
    "the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be\n",
    "able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from\n",
    "its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you\n",
    "combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\n",
    "neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n",
    "$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\n",
    "dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\n",
    "instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\n",
    "dimensional space?\n",
    "\n",
    "How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n",
    "That is, we represent the word $w$ by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements}\n",

    "where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will\n",
    "have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an enormous drawback to this representation, besides just how\n",
    "huge it is. It basically treats all words as independent entities with\n",
    "no relation to each other. What we really want is some notion of\n",
    "*similarity* between words. Why? Let's see an example.\n",

    "sentence? This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean\n",
    "*semantic similarity*, not simply having similar orthographic\n",
    "representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic\n",

    "extremely similar words (words whose embeddings point in the same\n",
    "direction) will have similarity 1. Extremely dissimilar words should\n",
    "have similarity -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the sparse one-hot vectors from the beginning of this\n",

    "attributes? Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural\n",
    "network learns representations of the features, rather than requiring\n",
    "the programmer to design them herself. So why not just let the word\n",
    "embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during\n",
    "training? This is exactly what we will do. We will have some *latent\n",
    "semantic attributes* that the network can, in principle, learn. Note\n",
    "that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable. That is,\n",
    "although with our hand-crafted vectors above we can see that\n",

    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) is frequently used in NLP deep\n",
    "learning. It is a model that tries to predict words given the context of\n",
    "a few words before and a few words after the target word. This is\n",
    "distinct from language modeling, since CBOW is not sequential and does\n",
    "not have to be probabilistic. Typcially, CBOW is used to quickly train\n",
    "word embeddings, and these embeddings are used to initialize the\n",
    "embeddings of some more complicated model. Usually, this is referred to\n",
    "as *pretraining embeddings*. It almost always helps performance a couple\n",
    "of percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOW model is as follows. Given a target word $w_i$ and an\n",
    "$N$ context window on each side, $w_{i-1}, \\dots, w_{i-N}$\n",
    "and $w_{i+1}, \\dots, w_{i+N}$, referring to all context words\n",
    "collectively as $C$, CBOW tries to minimize\n",

    "The CBOW model architecture tries to predict the current target word (the center word) based on the source context words (surrounding words). Considering a simple sentence, `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, this can be pairs of (context_window, target_word) where if we consider a context size 2 (2 words to the left, 2 to the right),  we have examples like `([the, quick, fox, jumps], brown)` and so on. Thus the model tries to predict the target_word based on the context_window words.\n",

However, it does not always result in exactly the same word embedding. The result of the formula is called the expected or the predicted word embedding. In this context, \"man\" is called the true or the actual word $t$. We want to find the word $p$ in the vocabulary, where the embedding of $p$ ($e_p$) is the closest to the predicted embedding (i.e. result of the formula). Then, we can check if $p$ is the same word as the true word $t$.  \n",
