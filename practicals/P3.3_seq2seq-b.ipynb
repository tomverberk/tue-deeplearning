The first step is to build a custom vocabulary from the raw training dataset. To this end, we tokenize each sentence and thereafter count the number of occurances of each token (=word or punctuation mark) in each of the articles using `counter`. Finally, we create the vocabulary by using the frequencies of each token in the counter. \n",

Futhermore, we add special tokens to both vocabulary: $<unk>$ for unknown tokens, $<pad>$ for padding, $<start>$ and $<end>$ as the first and last tokens of each sentence, respectively."

    "During inference using the seq2seq model you can make certain assumptions that should affect your implementation choices. You can assume conditional indepedance of the targets $P(Y|X)=P(y_{0:k}|X)=P(y_0|X)P(y_1|X)...P(y_k|X)$. In this case you can implement a greedy decoder that computes the most likely output at each step without taking into acount the selected outputs at previous steps. Or you can implement an autoregressive decoder that computes the joint probability of the output given the input $P(Y|X)=P(y_{0:k}|X)=P(y_0|X)P(y_1|y_0, X)...P(y_k|y_{0:k-1},X)$. \n"
