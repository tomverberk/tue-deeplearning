The first step is to build a custom vocabulary from the raw training dataset. To this end, we tokenize each sentence and thereafter count the number of occurances of each token (=word or punctuation mark) in each of the articles using `counter`. Finally, we create the vocabulary by using the frequencies of each token in the counter. \n",
